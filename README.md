# Homework Tasks

## Task 1

Study the main constructs, classes, and concepts discussed in the lesson.

## Task 2

Create a file, write some random data to it, and then close the file. After that, reopen the file, read the data, and output it to the console.

## Task 3

Write a program to search for a specific file on the disk. Add code that uses the `FileStream` class and allows viewing the file in a text window. Finally, add the option to compress the found file.

## Task 4

Create a WPF Application that allows users to store data in isolated storage.

Two solutions were implemented for this task:

- A *console application* for storing data in isolated storage on Mac.
- An application using *Avalonia UI*, which works cross-platform, including on Mac. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/yanamak89/MyAvaloniaApp/tree/master).

## Task 5

Go to the MSDN website. Use the MSDN search engine to independently find a description of each topic covered in the lesson, as shown below in the "Recommended Resources" section. Save the links and provide a brief description for each.

## Task 6

Create 100 directories on the disk with names ranging from `Folder_0` to `Folder_99`, then delete them.
